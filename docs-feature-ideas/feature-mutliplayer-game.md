# A UI game with multiple players

Assuming both .\feature-multi-vest-handling.md and .\feature-in-ui-games.md are done, I want a new game where a wheel spins, and the wheel has options on it.

For example, assuming we have 4 vests connected, the options would be:
- player X gets gun shot
- player y gets gun shot
- player z gets gun shot
- player w gets gun shot
- 2 random players get gun shot
- 1 random player get gun shot
- all players get gun shot
- 1 random player get shot in the back
