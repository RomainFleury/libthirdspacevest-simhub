## Phase E (deferred) — Capture source expansion & advanced capture reliability

This phase was moved out of the main plan and is considered “future/next steps”.

### Potential outcomes
- Support capture sources beyond monitor:
  - window capture (preferred UX)
  - process-based selection (if feasible)
- Better multi-monitor ergonomics
- Better handling for:
  - DPI scaling
  - borderless vs exclusive fullscreen
  - black-frame capture failure modes
- Performance + power optimizations

### Why deferred
- It increases implementation complexity and introduces OS/driver edge cases.
- The Phase A/B/C/D value is achievable with monitor capture + good ROI tooling.
