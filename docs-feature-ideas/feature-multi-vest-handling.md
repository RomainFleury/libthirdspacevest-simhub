# Multiple vest handling

For now, we can only have one vest connected one by one.

I would like to create a version of the app, maybe just another page, where we can assign different vests to a list of players.

So we can have "connected" players. 

I think it would make sense to have that always, so we always have the available connected vests, and we can handle all the connexions.
Still we would have the "preferred" or "main" vest, that would be the default one to send commands for all game integrations.

The goal of this feature is to be able to create games that handle the list of vests as list of players.
