About this mod
Adds haptic effects for "Gun Club VR" in the bhaptics Tactsuit models, Tactal, and Tactosy for arms and hands. Effects include gun and shotgun recoil and getting shot. This is far from my best mod, the game was horrible to hook into. But I thought it's better than nothing, so I uploaded it anyways. Please do not buy the game because of it!
