## What is bhaptics

bhaptics builds wearable haptic devices—vests, sleeves, gloves, face cushions—that map digital events to localized vibration. The hardware pairs with PC, VR, console, and mobile titles through the bhaptics Player software, which translates app or game telemetry into patterns across dozens of vibrating motors. The SDK exposes APIs for Unity, Unreal, and native integrations so you can script custom tactile feedback or hook into SimHub telemetry. In short, bhaptics lets experiences deliver precise, spatial haptics without inventing the firmware, protocols, or tooling yourself.
