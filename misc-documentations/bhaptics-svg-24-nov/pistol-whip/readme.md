Description is this one:

MOD – This game requires Mods to connect with the OWO System.

If the different mods do not work with the latest version of Melonloader, try an older version. In case they don’t work either, please contact us or post your problem in the Discord channel.

First of all, download and install MelonLoader from the official website: MelonLoader
Go to the “Automated Installation” section. Download MelonLoader from the link in the first point of this section.
Then, go to the official Nexusmods website: Nexusmods
To download the mod, log in. If you don’t have an account, register and create one.
In order to find all the mods, type ‘OWO’ in the search engine of the page.
Select the mod you want to install. Click on ‘Files’ and then on ‘MANUAL DOWNLOAD”.

Once you have downloaded it, extract the .zip of this mod in the main directory of the game, so that the folder of this game looks like this:

Open MelonLoader.Install.exe, click on ‘SELECT’ in the ‘Unity Game’ section from the ‘Automated’ menu and click on ‘INSTALL’.

Download and install the My OWO App from our website, Play Store or App Store.
Then open the My OWO App and connect the OWO Device to the app. In the menu, go to the ‘GAMES’ section.
On ‘GAMES’, click on ‘Scan Game’.

The OWO MOd is available here: https://www.nexusmods.com/pistolwhip/mods/2

Requirements

Installation

Download and install MelonLoader (and the requirements for it if needed) into the game's directory.
Download and extract the zip file of this mod into your game directory. It will add the mod DLL and "OWO" folder with sensations to the existing "Mods" directory, and the OWO library to the existing "UserLibs" directory.
That's it. Start your OWO app in the same network, connect to the OWO skin, and start up the game. The game might take an extra minute on the first startup, but should be fast afterwards.

If you have any issues or suggestions, the best way to contact me is to ping me on the OWO Discord: https://discord.gg/QfZjHwfhPQ

Adjustments
You can adjust the sensations you feel in the game simply by editing the ".owo" files in the "OWO" subfolder with the Sensation Creator. Sometimes the auto-connection fails, especially if your networks tends to filter some UDP packages. If you want to set a manual IP instead, you can place a file called "OWO_Manual_IP.txt" in the "Mods" directory, containing just one line with your desired IP, e.g. "192.168.1.25". That will make the mod connect to this IP instead of auto-searching for the OWO skin in the network.

Description

This mod communicates with the OWO skin when certain events are detected in "Pistol Whip" to give you haptic feedback. These are some of the currently implemented haptic effects:

Heart beat on low health
Recoil for shooting
Getting hit
Reloading
Healing
